                                <p>My name is Ivana. I'm from NY. I have my undergraduate degree in mathematics. After I got my graduate degree in education. Originally I wanted to be a math teacher. But now I work more in the curriculum development side of education. I work on creating educational content mostly for middle school and high school students that teachers use in their classes.</p>
                                <p>It’s very important to support the girls who are interested in science from a young age. Because, like it was with me, everybody is used to comparing themselves with others. And girls can not feel very confident with something where the other gender dominates. But the main thing is that they should know that they are capable of doing it.</p>

                    <h3>Childhood and school years</h3>
                    <p>15 years old. In fact in this age I failed my math class. It was the first and only class I have ever failed in my life. Until this moment I did very great at school and always had the best grades. So this failed math class was something new and had a big impact on my self confidence. I felt that I'm not as good at math as everyone else in the class. You know, you're always comparing yourself to others. Sometimes it can be really discouraging. At that age I felt like I never wanted to do math again. I felt like it wasn’t something for me. Nevertheless I continued to study hard at school. Luckily I had some really great teachers who explained the material in an interesting and encouraging way. I felt that these teachers cared about me. They saw that I had potencial. They were always giving me encouraging words, because maybe they could tell that I was not confident. And I think it’s very important for teachers to do that, to support their students. </p>

                    <img src="assets/images/women/ivana_lee/1.jpg">

                    <h3>College life</h3>
                    <p>When I went to college I didn’t want what I wanted to major in. I spent a year and a half undecided. Which means that I just took all the required classes to get my degree in a bunch of different areas. As I studied great at school I actually got a college credit for the class that I took for math. That means that I didn’t have to take math class in my first and a half year. I guess at some point I really missed taking my math class and I realised that it was where my interest is. So I decided to go for it. Not having math classes made me realise that I wanted to major in math. </p>

                    <p>In university I really liked the course of modern algebra. It's also called abstract algebra. It was very interesting. It seemed like it was a different kind of math. Usually when people think about math they think about numbers and data and theory, but math is a lot about problem solving, patterns and the study of changes. So I found this course very interesting. We were not just doing some calculations, but we solved real problems.</p>

                                <li>Unfortunately, nowadays our educational system has some problems with encouraging children about math. A lot of children think about math as something unnecessary, that can not be used in real life or be significant when they grow up. So I really wanted to show people that math is everywhere. So even if you're not looking for it you can find the random thing and see something mathematical about it. For example, I really like to take photos of different objects that I bumped into while just walking if this object has something related to math like some theory or geometry in particular. That’s how I came up with the idea to make my own instagram blog about math. Eventually I started to mention women in stem in my blog. The question I’m very interested to get answered by these women is the background of math. How specifically they use math in their everyday job.  </li>

                        <p> As I said I originally wanted to be a math teacher. So as a graduate student I had some experience teaching math in school. After I graduated I did about a year of tutoring students in math aither after school or on weekends. After that I actually got into the field where I'm now which is making educational material for schools. I really wanted to be a teacher because of the impact my math teachers made on me. Maybe deeply inside I also wanted to motivate students to fall in love with math. ALthough I'm not a teacher right now, I perceived my goal of encouraging people with the help of my blog. Eventually, it went to be the better way. Truly I would not make a good teacher, because maybe I'm too nice and students could take advantage of me. Right now I'm working in the field I love.</p>

                <p> Aside from my full time job I'm trying to  start a business. It’s a children clothing brand specifically for girls. We will have stem inspired designs. Starting to encourage young girls to be interested in stem is very important. And just seeing the difference between girls and boys’ clothes can be sad. When boys get all of the scientific cool clothes with space or  dinosaur prints. All those prints that are more inspiring to enter the stem field in the future. And girls have the mermaids and unicorns. If girls are growing up seeing this they might subconsciously think that stem is just for boys.  So our mission is opening their eyes to the possibility that they can grow up to be scientists. We’re aiming to launch a new line soon. We are going to have tshirts, dresses and shoes focused on diverse stem areas. </p>
