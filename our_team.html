Anastasia and Maria are two students from 4ESO. We have already worked together in the project of Technovation and sure we were incredibly content with the work of each other. When we find out about the competition of Wisibilizalas, we knew that we can't lose this opportunity. The objective of the Wisibilizalas was very similar to our worldview, so we were deligthted by the opportunity to find out more about the women from the STEM areas who are near us. </p>

                        <p>In the general physics course the ratio of women and men is a little bit more equal, but there are still a little bit more men than women. As I was progressing in my major, the number of women became smaller and smaller. But I want to say that  during my whole college experience I never had a female professor of general physics, they were all men. Yes, there were women, but they were teaching specialized subjects, like biophysics (which I didn’t take). So all the general standard courses I was taking there were never even one female physics professor. </p>
                        <p>On my highest level course at one point I was the only female physics student. I think it was in my quantum computing course. Firstly there was another one girl, but as the course got harder she dropped down, so I became the only female there. Generally, in the classroom of around 50 students there were 3-4 females.</p>

                        <p>My name is María de los Ángeles Delgado and I'm 15 years old. I was born in Colombia but I've lived here, in Spain for 11 years. 
                            I'm in 4th of ESO due to I've skipped one grade. I love studying, my hobbie can de defined as "learning new things" My favourite subject is Mathematics and I
                            love number theory and calculus. I also like physics; specially quantum physics, astrohpysics and nuclear physics.
                            I've been a student at Qubit by Qubit, a course of quantum computing offered by The Coding School, IBM and MIT.
                            Furthermore, I love learning about neuroscience. I'm also a graphic designer! My notes and posters about the fields
                            I study are considered perfect by the students who use them. I'm also writing some books, one of them is science fiction
                            and the other ones, hopefully, will be useful for all the students around the world. I'm the CEO and founder of MeteoriteGlobal,
                            a community for students, teachers, people who want to learn and people who want to teach. I'm the Student Ambassador of Spain
                            of Technovation, and I've participated two years in this program, creating and coding two apps.</p>
                        <p>I learn everything by myself, I learnt Web-Development last year, during quarantine but since I was 7 years old, my father introduced me into the world of technology, we started with Arduino! This opportunity is the perfect project to show my skills on HTML5, CSS3, JavaScrpit and Design! It's good to see that there are opportunities for students, related to science and Technology. Let's get as high as a Meteorite! </p>

                        <p> My name is Anastasia. I'm 15 years old. And this year is my first year here in Spain. I was born in Ucraine and always was very curious kid. My parents sometimes got tired of my unstoppable stream of questions. From early age I was a connoisseur of music. At the age of 5, I started to play piano. A little bit later guitar attracted my attention. Also I tried myself in drums and singing.</p>
                        <p>I always was good at school. That's why teachers proposed to take part in competitions of english language, ucrainian literature, biology, informatics and math. I did these competitions for three years and gained a lot of rewards and dyplomas. At the same time I continued giving piano concerts.</p>
                        <p>I always was interested in technologies. I always was good with computer and computer science was a whole new interesting world for me. I started to learn programming by myself. The area of programming I enjoy the most is web-development. I studied HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Php by myself. This webpage is a great opportunity to use my skills on practise.</p>
