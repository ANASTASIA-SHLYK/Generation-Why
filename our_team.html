Anastasia and Maria are two students from 4ESO. We have already worked together in the project of Technovation and sure we were incredibly content with the work of each other. When we find out about the competition of Wisibilizalas, we knew that we can't lose this opportunity. The objective of the Wisibilizalas was very similar to our worldview, so we were deligthted by the opportunity to find out more about the women from the STEM areas who are near us. </p>

                    <div class="intro-text">
                        <p>My name is Tatiana Labarta and I am a teacher of secondary education at Salesianos Huesca. My main interest areas are English and Economy. I studied International Economics at Zaragoza and Maastricht University and afterwards I got a degree in Translation and Interpreting.
                           My passion is education and also technology. I try to link them in my classes. Technology has the power to engage students in learning.

                           I have taught at Zaragoza University in several fields such as Econometrics, Maths and also English. I have done research about international organisations and during 10 years I have worked as an admin-manager and researcher of an NGO related to Regional Economic Research.
                           My interest in technology grows each day and I think it is of huge importance to use it in schools. In our school, each student has their own laptop and we work with the ICTs constantly. 

                           The students of this team, Maria and Anastasia, have instigated a genuine revolution in our school, the STEM revolution. New opportunities to develop technological projects in our center have arisen with them. </p>

                        <p>My name is María de los Ángeles Delgado and I'm 15 years old. I was born in Colombia but I've lived here, in Spain for 11 years. 
                            I'm in 4th of ESO due to I've skipped one grade. I love studying, my hobbie can de defined as "learning new things" My favourite subject is Mathematics and I
                            love number theory and calculus. I also like physics; specially quantum physics, astrohpysics and nuclear physics.
                            I've been a student at Qubit by Qubit, a course of quantum computing offered by The Coding School, IBM and MIT.
                            Furthermore, I love learning about neuroscience. I'm also a graphic designer! My notes and posters about the fields
                            I study are considered perfect by the students who use them. I'm also writing some books, one of them is science fiction
                            and the other ones, hopefully, will be useful for all the students around the world. I'm the CEO and founder of MeteoriteGlobal,
                            a community for students, teachers, people who want to learn and people who want to teach. I'm the Student Ambassador of Spain
                            of Technovation, and I've participated two years in this program, creating and coding two apps.</p>
                        <p>I learn everything by myself, I learnt Web-Development last year, during quarantine but since I was 7 years old, my father introduced me into the world of technology, we started with Arduino! This opportunity is the perfect project to show my skills on HTML5, CSS3, JavaScrpit and Design! It's good to see that there are opportunities for students, related to science and Technology. Let's get as high as a Meteorite! </p>

                        <p> My name is Anastasia. I'm 15 years old. And this year is my first year here in Spain. I was born in Ucraine and always was very curious kid. My parents sometimes got tired of my unstoppable stream of questions. From early age I was a connoisseur of music. At the age of 5, I started to play piano. A little bit later guitar attracted my attention. Also I tried myself in drums and singing.</p>
                        <p>I always was good at school. That's why teachers proposed to take part in competitions of english language, ucrainian literature, biology, informatics and math. I did these competitions for three years and gained a lot of rewards and dyplomas. At the same time I continued giving piano concerts.</p>
                        <p>I always was interested in technologies. I always was good with computer and computer science was a whole new interesting world for me. I started to learn programming by myself. The area of programming I enjoy the most is web-development. I studied HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Php by myself. This webpage is a great opportunity to use my skills on practise.</p>
