                            <div class="intro-text">
                                <p> My name is Irene. I'm from Zaragoza. I’m currently a researcher in the UK. I started by studying veterinary studies at the university of Zaragoza. But I did my last year as an Erasmus student in Paris. After that I moved to Murcia, where I did masters in biology and technology of reproduction in mammals. I did my practical part of the master's degree in the university of Lleida (Spain) where I was working on the reproductive control of dairy cattle in cows. I went to Ireland to do  my PHD for 4 years. Now I’m in the UK, I’ve been here for two years at the University of Leeds doing the postdoc. I think I will be moving back to Spain soon. </p>

                                <p>I feel very lucky to have an oppoetunity to travel that much. I'm working in the field I love and my job sirely is very important part of my life. I would like to encourage more children to fall in love with science. Svience open your eyes on a world around you. You are blind till you descover basic aspects of how the world really works. </p>

                    <h3>Childhood and adolescente</h3>
                    <p>At the age of 15 everything started to change a little bit for me. I have wanted to be a vet since I was very very little. At this age I decided to pursue science more. Furthermore, the circle of friends I have at the moment, they are from the time I was about 15-16 years old. So, I think It was a very good time of life. 
                    Funny but I think I was much more confident than I feel now. Now I look back and I think: “when I was a teenager I really knew what I wanted.” Because right now I find myself hesitating more than I did back then. I think it’s just different moments in life. Everyone changes with time. And I think as a teenager I was very very confident. I knew what I wanted to study, I knew what I wanted to do with my life.
                    </p>

                    <h3>University experience</h3>
                    <p>When you finish your bachelor's degree, you have lots of exams. Definitely it's a massive responsibility to get prepared for them.  It feels like a massive load on you. And when you pass them and you go to university you think “Yes, I pass them. I must be super smart. I’m gonna do it”. But when you get to your educational institution you feel very puzzled, you think to yourself: “Okay, okay, where should I go?” When you sit there and the professors at once start talking, you think: ”Oh, I guess now I’m supposed to take notes”. It’s just your first day, and you don't completely know what you are meant to do. You just go there, and you soonly start to feel like a little girl. When you are in secondary school you are the oldest one, but here you are again the little one. But with time, you realise we're all the same. </p>


                    <p>I have very good memories from uni. It was just completely different from school because it was getting into very specific topics and we had all many different modules. We started doing practicals. I really liked that. You will start with anatomy. On the first day, it was like “OMG, we're actually doing this”. Were looking at the animals or we were in the hospital - it was incredible, we were doing real things, not just studying theory. That was wonderful. We also got more freedom. You’re older, you start getting more friends, you can go out. It just changes. </p>

                    <h3>Gender ratio</h3>
                    <p>Veterinary sciences traditionally were very masculine. Now they are not. I would say between 70-80% were women when I was studying in Zaragoza. In France I think the ratio was more similar. In Ireland there were a few more men but there were still more women. </p>

                        <h3>Funny stories</h3>

                        <h4>Escaped sheep</h4>

                        <div class="list">
                            <ul>
                                <li>There was one accident when the sheep escaped. We were working with different animals. And one day someone forgot to close the gate. So the sheep escaped inside the building and they were chasing it all around the campus. </li>

                            </ul>
                        </div>

                        <h4>Farting horse</h4>
                        <div class="list">
                            <ul>
                                <li>We were doing our practicals and we were working there with the horse. The horse was just standing there, the lecturer told us about the projections. We were all going around the animal. While the lecturer was talking the horse suddenly started farting. We all stand very quiet. The horse was super relaxed and the audience stopped in silence for nearly a minute.</li>

                            </ul>
                        </div>

                        <h4>Independent cat</h4>
                        <div class="list">
                            <ul>
                                <li>When you have animals a lot of funny things happen. Also in the vet school there used to be one cat. I'm not sure if she’s still alive. She used to just go around everywhere. She was standing near the door of the library waiting for someone to open it, so she could sleep inside or she could go to the toilet and sit near the sink to ask for water. It seemed like she was allowed to be everywhere. She was all around with people, but she didn’t like to be petted. She was kind of mean to people.</li>

                            </ul>
                        </div>


                        <h4>Erasmus</h4>

                        <div class="list">
                            <ul>
                                <li> I’m from Zaragoza and I used to study in Zaragoza. So I was still living at my parents’ house. I know it’s very different when you have to move. For other people, they suddenly have to be very responsible. You have to find a place to live, you have to pay rent and other things. So I didn't do it in my first year. But I won an Erasmus in my last year and I had to move to France. So soon it was not just leaving my parents’ house, but it was actually changing the country. It was starting from zero. Firstly, you get very excited: “Wow, i’m going to this place. It’s gonna be amazing”. But then you think: “Omg, I have so many things to plan”. In my case, I was moving to a residence in the university. So it was easier.</li>

                        <p> We’re investigating the layer of cells in the uterus that are in direct contact with embryos. We are making a bunch of different things. It’s not just one project. But all the things I do are related to that. I work in a lab with extracellular vesicles. They are small particles which cells use to communicate between them. So we are looking at how the embryo and the uterus are using these vesicles to communicate. </p>
                    </div>

                    <h2 class="my" class="right-board">Cultural differences</h2>
                    <div class="intro-text">
                        <p> This difference depends not only on the country you live in but also if you live in a big city or you live in the countryside. So Zaragoza is a relatively big city, Paris was massive. Sometimes in the big city you can feel more lonely. Every time you want to do anything it takes you ages to move. Por exemple, in Paris I was living in the south east and using an underground would take you at least half an hour to get to the city center and half an hour to get back. So if you wanted to do anything you would have to spend at least 2 hours. 
                        When I was in Murcia, which is two times smaller than Zaragoza, everything was much closer. But it still has lots of hustle and bustle. When I was in Gales it was summer. There were a lot of people, because it was a holiday. When I moved to Ireland, it was completely different, because I was living in the countryside. I was living in a town of between 6 and 7 thousand people. It was very different to the countryside of Spain. They have roads everywhere, and people live literally in the middle of nowhere. So every single job requires car driving. Then I came here to Leeds. It is located in the north of England. It’s about the same size as Zaragoza. It's quite nice city to live in.
