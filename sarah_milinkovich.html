                                <p> My name is Sarah Milinkovich. I live in Canada and study at the university of Guelph. I'm in my fourth year of a 5 year program studying microbiology. I'm also doing a minor in microchemistry because two of them are pretty related. Originally I wanted to be a doctor, so I was in biomedical science. But some time later I learned about the world of microbiology and bacteria and I was incredibly interested in it. I realised that it was what I wanted to do with my life. I was so fascinated by all these little things around us that we can't even see, that I decided to continue my studies in this field.</p>

                    <h3>Childhood and school years</h3>
                    <p>I remember that growing up I hated science. My mum was a math teacher, so I thought a little about doing math in the future.  But when I was around 15 years old I had one amazing teacher who kept on encouraging me to continue to study science because I was so good at it. I'm very grateful to this person. He stayed after class to explain something I didn’t get during the class. He was so passionate about the science that made me fall in love with science too. As I was growing up my interest in the biological sciences was growing with me. My favourite classes  were math and biology (thanks to that teacher). I didn’t really know what I could do with both math and biology. Thanks to his advice I am studying science in university right now. Eventually I went to the University of Guelph because I wanted to do more academia. I was planning to do a Phd and maybe become a professor, so I thought that this University would be the right place for me to go. </p>

                    <img src="assets/images/women/sarah_milinkovich/2.png">

                    <h3>Lab experience</h3>
                    <p>Most of the labs that I've been in were teaching labs. So in there teachers just try to teach us the techniques we will need for the future.  This summer I will be working in the lab with my professor and I'm very excited to work with her. She works a lot on studying human microbiomes. The research we will be working on is going to be very interesting. The stool samples of the people who live in the amazon area will be taken. These people are not a part of western civilization and diet. And we will be comparing their microbiome with the people that have fast food all the time. It’s just crazy to see how much healthier they are compared to us. The objective of the research is also to see what we can do to be more healthier and improve our microbiome. </p>

                    <h3>How did you get your work in this lab?</h3>
                    <p>I just started emailing my professors, telling them which note I got in their class, showing my resumes, telling about the work I did and showing my interest in doing research with them. I know everyone always thinks that there is someone better or smarter, but the main thing is to try. So one of the professors answered my email. We met, had a little conversation and she took me to her lab. That’s how I got a job for this summer. </p>

                                <li>I can definitely say that the gender ratio is pretty equal right now. In fact there are more female students in my faculty. But in the past it was different. It’s very curious to see the pictures on the wall of classes who graduated years ago. You can observe the evolution to more gender equal classes through years. Talking about the professors, there are a few more men.  </li>

                                <li>In my old house where I lived most of the people were studying art. When I tried to ask them some questions or start a conversation about science they would look lost and didn’t know what to tell. Now all of my roommates are in STEM areas. One of them studies animal biology, some girls are in the same program as me, and we also have an engineer and a biomed student. So now when I ask for help with my studies they all are able to answer. It’s really nice to live in a science environment where everyone has similar views of the world as you. It’s nice to have a little science conversations outside the school. </li>

                    <div class="intro-text">
                        <p> Preparing for the university was crazy. Personally in high school I didn’t have to study much because things came naturally into my head and I always had good grades. When I was preparing for university I understood that subjects are going to be much harder than in high school. So that summer leading to the university I tried to reinvent the ways that I study and find study methods that work for me. Very essential thing for those who are going to study far away from home like me is to learn all necessary things like cooking, cleaning and taking care of yourself. That helped the transition between highschool and university happen much easier. </p>

                        <p>Here in Canada in the first couple of years the classes you have to take are very broad.  So every student in STEM takes the same exact courses for the first year. It's nice that they do it. Because in my case, I changed my mind and decided that I didn’t want to do what I originally wanted to do in university. So switching to another program was simple for me because I didn’t have to worry about the classes I might have missed.</p>

                        <p>Right now I'm in organic chemistry and I'm not  a big fan of that. In my major which is microbiology a lot of courses that i'm taking today are very relevant. But from some of the courses I really need one little concept to support my knowledge in microbiology but I have to take the whole course in order to get my degree. </p>

                            <p> The professor that I'm going to be working with is definitely a role model for me. I often say that I want to be like her one day. She is so inspiring all the time. This is actually the first semester that she teaches us. As soon as she entered the classroom she became so interesting to me. She spoke passionately about her subject. Furthermore she is very respected in her field. I remember one day she taught us Monday morning from 9:30 to 10:30, then at 1:30 she was hopping on the plane to get to Paris where she had to speak at the conference. And then she was back by 5 to teach our class again. She is definitely a good role model. </p>

                        <p> When the pandemic started I wasn’t at school at all I was working. The company I was working for produces food for the country. I was testing all the samples to make sure they all are safe and good for everybody to eat. It obviously was essential so I had to continue working throughout the pandemic. I worked in a very small lab with one other person. We just splitted the lab completely in half and we always stayed on our own side so we could maintain social distance wearing masks. </p>
                        <p>I started going back to school a little bit later after the pandemic started so I yet didn’t have any online school experience. So I had to ask my roommates all the questions about studying online. A little while I adapted to this schedule. In fact I think that the pandemic was advantageous for schools because they have learnt about so many new things and technology they can use. That can benefit students. For example my professor from organic chemistry has a little bit of an accent so sometimes it was difficult to understand her. But thanks to the recording of the lectures I can always watch them later, slow down the speed and return to the concept I didn’t get from the first time. </p>

                <p> In the future I will definitely do my masters and maybe Phd. I think I really want to continue working in academia. One of the things that I love about microbiology is that it’s constantly evolutioning. There always will be new discoveries, new bacterias or new viruses like Covid. I don’t like doing the same thing day by day. I like doing something new, being active and learning new stuff that’s interesting for me. I'm really happy that my work can offer this to me. Also I potentially want to be a professor. Because like I said in my faculty right now there are not many female professors so I want to become one and move the ratio towards 50/50.  </p>
