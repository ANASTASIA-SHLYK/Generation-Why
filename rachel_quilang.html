                                <p>My name is Rachel Quilang. I'm currently living in Leeds, UK. I work at the University of Leeds. I'm a postdoctoral research assistant in reproductive biology. I specialize in studying placenta. So my work is deeply related to pregnancy and the function of the placenta. I study how it develops in healthy pregnancies as well as in pregnancies that have complications such as diabetes or if the mother is sick. Although I love the mom and the baby side of pregnancy, my favourite part is placenta. </p>

                                <p>If you hesitate about doing science, definitely go for it. If that's what you want to study, pursue that. Don’t be afraid to ask questions. Even if you know that your quetion is stupid and you will look stupid ask it and get the information you need. Ask for advice. If you don’t know what career options are available for you just ask someone.  </p>

                    <h2 class="my">Life and Career</h2>
                    <h3>Childhood and school years</h3>
                    <p>I grew up in America, in Atlanta Georgia. I lived in Georgia until I was 21. Then I moved to the UK. I’d say that I grew up in a very conservative and religious household. I think on TV you see a lot of representations of american high schools. I didn’t live that life. I had quite quiet days studying a lot. I wasn’t really encouraged to get higher education due to my family’s religious background, which didn’t motivate having higher education. In my family it was more encouraged to pick some technical skill which in fact is such as good. I never considered going to a higher educational institution. </p>



                    <h3>Starting realise my interest for science</h3>
                    <p>I actually used to be a hairdresser. I went to the heir school in Georgia. I trained as a cosmetologist which involves skin care, hair and nails. There is actually a lot of science and chemistry in this field. Of course I liked the artistic and creative part of this job, but the scientific part attracted me more. Understanding why the hair would look a certain way if you put different chemicals on it was really interesting for me.  In this school we also studied anatomy of the skin and biology related to the beauty industry. Although I really enjoyed the science part of the process I put science on the background because I didn’t think it was something available for me. </p>

                    <h3>How the STEM journey began</h3>

                    <p>I moved from America to Scotland where I was a hairdresser for about 5 years. I was working in the barber shop so I was mostly cutting man’s hair. That’s why I was getting a lot of students from the university of Glasgow in this barbershop. I remember that one of them told me that universities in Scotland are paid for so you don’t need to. I never knew that even though I had been living there already for 5 years. I was really amazed by that fact. He told me that anyone can go to the university, he or she just has to apply. So I thought maybe I could go for it and apply.</p>

                    <p>I know it sounds a little bit random. But anyway out of the blue I decided to apply for tuition to the University in Scotland. They accepted my application. I was 25 at that moment. Because of my age I was considered a mature student in Scotland. Even though I was 25 I didn’t feel mature. That’s how I got to the University. I wanted to change something in my life and I wanted to do something in the science area. The first course had a very broad general science background. It gave me a good foundation in biology, microbiology, chemistry, math and statistics. It was how I started my STEM journey in the science field. </p>

                        <p>The application process at first was very unfamiliar to me. One of my barber shop clients advised me to visit a webpage ukas.com which explained all the steps of the educational  ladder in Scotland. I, as a mature student from another country, had to show my papers from the highschool in America and go for an interview to the selected university. </p>

                        <p>My university experience was a little weird for me because most of my classmates were much younger than me. But they were all really friendly. During university I also had a part0time job. One of the classes that I went to was super cool and I remember it very well. It was microbiology class. In my university there was a lecturer who specializes in parasites. The first time she went to the classroom she was wearing amazing high-heeled leather shoes. And I was amazed who she was. I thought she was so cool. She was our lecturer. She was so enthusiastic about the parasites that it was really infectious. She definitely encouraged me to learn more about parasitology. She was one of the examples of really cool science people that I met during my entrance to the science community. </p>

                            <p> During my first year all of my professors were male. In my second year I'm pretty sure that I had two more women as lecturers. I would say that it was mostly dominated by men in lecturing roles. Talking about the students, the ratio was quite equal.</p>

                            <p>My 3rd year of university was very stressful for me because of some personal problems. My body responds to stress with sleep. I usually just fall asleep. I remember one time I was sitting in the lecture. I thought if I sat in the front row I wouldn’t fall asleep. But I ended up falling asleep and snoring a little bit. My friends who were sitting in the same row as me didn’t stop me to begin with. They just didn’t know it was me till they saw my head bobbing and they knocked me.  The lecture didn’t tell me anything thank god. But that was kind of funny and embarrassing. </p>

            <div class="intro-text text">
                <p>At first I didn’t even consider doing the Phd. I was talking with my supervisor and she asked me about my plans after graduation. My answer was very unsure, I was thinking about working for the NHS (national health system) as a biomedical scientist.  But as for me this work had no creativity and was very robotic. She asked me if I had ever considered doing a Phd. She told me that she saw potential in me and strongly advised me to think more about doing Phd. In Scotland if you have high marks in your undergraduate degree and you go through an interviewing process you can make your Phd without doing a masters. Finally this supervisor told me that she had applied for grant money to do some research and she would be happy if I wanted to do my Phd with her. The PhD I signed up for was sponsored for three years. You also can take a fourth year to write your thesis. So my Phd will take around 4 years</p>

                <p>I found my current job through twitter because my supervisor recommended this platform as an opportunity to communicate with people of different scientific backgrounds. If you make a page only for your research work and you follow other people who are doing research they often advertise if there is a necessity in any worker. I had a few job interviews in New Castle and in London. Eventually I saw an advert for a research project in Leeds and I applied for it. They accepted me. This project was exploring the pregnancy during diabetes.</p>

                <p>Our university is connected to one hospital.

If they give their consent we collect the placenta from the delivery room. </p>
