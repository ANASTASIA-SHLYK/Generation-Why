                                <p> My name is Marina Azpiroz, I am a biotechnologist and I am currently twenty-seven years old.
                                    My motivation has always been science, science majors have always caught my attention.
                                    I am currently working in Podoactiva, which is a company from Huesca (in Huesca), whose projection is being incredibly large, and I am currently in an R&D department where I collaborate with podiatrists, engineers or physiotherapists, to develop solutions that improve the lives of Podoactiva patients and that can be used for the common good; from developing sensors that allow detecting frailty, or mild cognitive impairment in the case of older people, etc.
                                    In addition, I am studying a Master's degree for teachers. I give practical classes in a school and do my final Master's thesis on the demotivation of students towards scientific careers.
                                    I think it is necessary to make women and girls visible in science, and above all in showing models of women in science, in science careers and STEM careers.</p>

                    <h3>First studies and degree</h3>
                    <p>I studied in Huesca, Spain, at the Santa Ana school. Later in Valencia I did my Baccalaureate, and then I started at the Catholic University of Valencia.
                      During my compulsory secondary education, I considered studying medicine or biotechnology, and finally I opted for biotechnology because my grades were not enough to enter medicine, which I do not regret at all since my career I it has offered so many outings and opportunities.</p>

                    <img src="assets/images/women/lisa_chan/5.jpg">

                    <h3>Master and first company</h3>
                    <p>When I finished my degree in biotechnology, I did a master's degree in biomedical research, which connected with my taste for medicine.
                       Later I started working in a medical company in Valencia where we developed improvement projects for people with cancer. For example, I was working on a European project in which we had to make a clinical support computer program for patients with breast cancer, enter their data and, based on them, tell us what type of chemotherapy that patient needs, what type radiotherapy; what was more convenient based on those parameters.
                       I was presenting a project at the European Commission, one of the most important moments of my career.</p>

                                    Teaching is something that I have always liked a lot, and the whole issue of Covid and everything we have experienced made me reflect.
                                    I am doing the Master on-line, and I also believe that it is the moment to do it. I like it because really transmitting that passion that you have for what you do I think is beautiful, and I think it is interesting that students also feel the same way, and try to transmit that passion for science to them and that they move towards science, through careers scientific.
                                     In fact, today I have asked my students a questionnaire about what I am working on in my Final Master's Thesis, motivation. And it has surprised me that many are not going to study science careers, only 7 out of 20 are going to study science careers. It is worrying.</li>

                    <div class="intro-text">
                        <p>After this experience, I started in Podoactiva, as already mentioned in the introduction.
                           There, for example, there is a branch that is dedicated to 3D bioprinting. Within this branch, we collaborate within the Innovative COT laboratory with the Miguel Servet Hospital, in Zaragoza, and what we do is 3D reconstructions of bones, fractures, etc., so that doctors have a vision of what they face in a operation.
                           We also do many things related to models, for example, for arm fractures, or for a tool that we call here anti-equines, for equine feet, which is a problem that occurs especially in young patients.
                           For sports we make masks, in case, for example, soccer players break their noses or get injured and we have to do a 3D scan of their faces in record time, and with it the engineering colleagues design them in based on facial geometry that a mask has been 3D scanned. So, what we do is 3D print that mask that has been designed on the computer, and then that mask undergoes a post-processing, which we say is the most manual part, they apply carbon fiber to it, and we already have a fully customized mask based on the geometry of the patient. And we do the same for shin guards, and for all kinds of products that you can imagine that are personalized.
                           The issue of cells is very useful, since people who break an arm put on a cast, which can be very annoying on many occasions. So the Podoactiva engineering team has managed to design a cell that has small holes, which allows the skin to breathe and you can even bathe with it. You can do whatever you want in summer.</p>

                               And then there is a Hungarian scientist, and she is the one who discovered how to make the coronavirus vaccine based on RNA, because there are vaccines that work with RNA. They want to propose her for the Nobel Prize and her name is Katalin Kariko.</p>

Or when you see someone who has broken an arm and has a difficulty, and you have made him a cell. Or for example, when a surgical operation has been performed at the Miguel Servet Hospital with a tool that has been designed here, and the doctors have had a successful operation.</p>

            <div class="intro-text text">
                <p> My favorite subject was genetic engineering, because it was a very practical subject in which we developed a lot of practical things, I will try to explain it in an easy way. All the resources you need to make a vaccine, to improve a vaccine or to make a treatment; We did all of this with genetic engineering. To develop, if a plant needed to grow, we made some vectors to help it with that growth. All very practical.
                    The subject that I liked the least was Biostatistics, because you love it or hate it, and in my case it was constantly hating it. I didn't like Bioreactors too much either, because it was a very mathematical subject, very physical, and I liked molecular biology, physiology, everything that involved purely biological subjects more.
                    The truth is that I remember the gender proportion quite the same. In fact, we were quite a few girls. I believe that in Biotechnology it is not noticeable as in engineering, because I do remember that in 2nd year of High School I did the scientific and technological path at the same time, because I did not know very well if Biotechnology or Medicine, but I do remember that the baccalaureate degrees that were purely technological (one of my best friends was studying it) there were three girls, and the rest all boys. In other words, I do believe that in engineering there is much more gender difference than in careers such as Biotechnology, Biology or Medicine. I believe that there the role of women is more present than still in the field of engineering.</p>
