                                <p> My name is Lisa. I'm a recent physics graduate from the city college of New York. I have been really active in the science communication community. I was the president of the physics club when I was at college and I hosted a lot of outreach programs and events for students. I made these events public, so everyone could come, even those who are not studying at college. I had this stargazing event and there were a lot of people from the street who were curious. So they participated too. We were a community who spread the passion about physics and science to the general public. In college I worked several jobs. I was an instructor in the NY Math Academy and coaching services. I’ve also been involved in research. I worked in an optics lab for 3 years. The place was called the Institute for Ultrafast Spectroscopy and Lasers. And now I want to produce Covid19 medical devices.</p>

                    <h3>Childhood and school years</h3>
                    <p>I remember the moment I chose to major in physics pretty vividly.When I was a kid, like a lot of kids I wanted to be everything. I felt a natural curiosity about everything. A big part of my identity is some of the struggles I went through as a kid. I came from an economically disadvantaged background. So I had a lot of struggles from an early age. I had to start working pretty early. Around 14 years old I got my first job. I liked all of the subjects in school, but it was hard for me to do well in school because of my family. I chose to do physics at high school. So it was the age of 15 when I started to think about what I want to do the rest of my life. Because of my economic background I was not thinking that I can do something I personally enjoy. Everybody had a serious job dream. They wanted either to be a lawyer or economist or something like this. Those kinds of jobs that most people see as successful. No one around me wanted to be a scientist. </p>

                    <img src="assets/images/women/lisa_chan/5.jpg">

                    <h3>Why did you choose to be a physicist?</h3>
                    <p>At the age of 16 my mum passed away. It was the time of health problems in my family and poverty. So it was a very stressful time period for me. But ultimately it actually let me know what I wanted to do the rest of my life. It made me think about who I was and how I want to contribute back to society and what makes me genuinely happy. </p>


                    <p>When I discovered physics I realised that it made my world more interesting. When I was participating in physics I felt like I was living in the world beyond my everyday reality. When I had stressful situations, physics was a thing that still made me appreciate all around. Studying physics is basically almost studying everything. It is the foundation of everything. So it deeply connects with my childhood and desire to know everything. In high school I dedicated my entire time to studying this subject. It was really hard. I don’t want to say that physics is an easy STEM subject to study. It’s hard even for physitiscs. In fact it was one of the reasons I chose it. It was a challenge which is hard to overcome, but the reward was so enlightening, that I put all my effort into studying it. And in college I became completely sure that it was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.

                                <li>My job was mostly at teaching. And at some point I was paid for my research, so that was also my job. When I was about 14-15 I was a teacher’s assistant. So my first teaching experience was way before college. That was what I really liked. In college I had 2 teaching opportunities: one was to be an instructor in the learning center and another was me being the exhibit guide (I was working with the science and art engagement in NY). There was this exhibit, where we taught the public about the physics in sports. It was a very interactive exhibit where people could touch things, do all of the calculations of how high for example they can jump when they shoot the basketball ball. As the instructor I was helping a lot of students who were struggling at school. I would usually tutor them on their actual curriculum or hometast assignments, but if they had free time I could teach them something new.</li>

                    <div class="intro-text">
                        <p>In the general physics course the ratio of women and men is a little bit more equal, but there are still a little bit more men than women. As I was progressing in my major, the number of women became smaller and smaller. But I want to say that  during my whole college experience I never had a female professor of general physics, they were all men. Yes, there were women, but they were teaching specialized subjects, like biophysics (which I didn’t take). So all the general standard courses I was taking there were never even one female physics professor. </p>
                        <p>On my highest level course at one point I was the only female physics student. I think it was in my quantum computing course. Firstly there was another one girl, but as the course got harder she dropped down, so I became the only female there. Generally, in the classroom of around 50 students there were 3-4 females.

This year we had dinosaur costumes. As you can imagine everyone was suprised to see a dinosaur working in the lab. If you think it must ne very uncomfortable to work or study in such costumes you are right. But anyway we had a good time. </p>

            <div class="intro-text text">
                <p> I had different work-life-study balances throughout college. It was actually really hard in the beginning to manage all of this. I definitely got overwhelmed several times. And there were some times when I wasn’t doing so well in some areas of my life. But eventually I did manage to balance everything. During all my adult life, I had some kind of research, at work sometimes I also had some research or teaching experience. And I always made time for my physics club, my community, which I really value. I would say that this community thing played a bigger role than I expected. Even if I had some troubles, my community was what made me go, they were my support group.
                So sometimes I could not do well in some of the areas, but eventually over time I was able to adjust how much stuff I can take and how to manage my time to fit all of these things. </p>
