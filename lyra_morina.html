                                <p> My name is Lyra Morina. I'm a scientist, more specifically an immunologist in the National Institute of Health which is a big research institute in the United States. In the university of Merlin I studied cell biology and economics. I did my bachelor degree there. Then I had the opportunity to come to the research in the National Institutes of Health (NIH).</p>

                                <p>I'm interested in the career path of MdPhd, which means that you can get your degree as a doctor and your research degree at the same time. In this way you can be a doctor and a scientist. You can study science and try to discover better understanding of diseases as well as cure them, seeing patients and working in the hospital.

                    <h2 class="my">Life and Career</h2>
                    <h3>Childhood and school years</h3>
                    <p>When I was 15 it was a time of a big transition in my life, so it’s funny that you ask me about specifically this age. That was the year I moved to the United States. Before that I lived in Africa for ten years, because my family moved often as my parents work in Public Health.</p> 

                    <p>Originally I'm from Kosovo which is a small country in South Eastern Europe. I'm very proud to be born there. I'm ethnicity albanian. I speak albanian at home with my family and I always grew up very connected to my culture. I visited my country every summer when we moved to Africa.</p> 

                    <p>When I moved to the United States it was definitely a culture shock for me even though I always went to the international school. The US has a very different society and culture. I think overcoming that and also getting used to a new educational system allowed me to learn how to be adaptable and adjust to changes and challenges. Probably adapting to the new country is easier when you’re small. But the older you get the more effort you have to make to become a part of a new society. In fact the qualities I got in the young age with all the movements and adaptations helped me in the future and build my character. 
                    </p>

                    <img src="assets/images/women/lyra_morina/2.jpeg">

                    <h3>How did you choose want you want to do?</h3>
                    <p>I can’t say that I knew from a young age who I wanted to be. Although I found all my classes stimulating and interesting, science ones were my favourite. I vividly remember the moment when little me was in the library looking for detective books. And suddenly books with physics experiments attracted my attention. It was a book with easy experiments for children that I could do in my home kitchen. It was how my falling in love with physics and science started. </p>

                    <h3>What did your college life look like?</h3>
                    <p>As I got older I started to realise that from all the classes I liked biology the most. It was very interesting for me because of the importance biology has on a people's life. Also I was curious about the way our bodies work. Also I took the molecular biology class in the summer at the University of John Hopkins. There I learned the basic biology principles and the diseases they can relate to. For example, when a gene is mutated and goes wrong the proteins can result in dysfunction in your body. That's how you get a disease. That summer class inspired me to go into biomedical research.</p>

                    <p>When I started college I was sure I wanted to do research and get a PhD in the future. Then in my 3rd year of college somebody asked me if I had ever thought about MdPhD. It’s a program where you can be both a doctor and a scientist. I had never ever heard about that before and I had never thought about myself as a doctor. In fact it’s a little scary when you are one year from finishing college, you have a certain plan in your head and you change your mind.</p>

                    <p>Surely you can’t decide to become a doctor overnight. It’s a difficult process which requires a lot of thinking. That was what I did. I thought a lot about all the pros and cons of doing the MdPhd. Eventually I decided to go for it. In the US, getting to medical school is not as much dependent on the exams and paperwork (because I feel like that’s how it works in other countries). In the US, applying to medical school has a lot of components besides the exams. You have to do volunteer work, practice in clinics, have a strong GPA and a lot of different parts of application. So I had a long journey ahead.</p>

                        <p> Gender ratio strongly depends on the particular class. In our math or engineering classes it’s usually many more male than female. I remember taking a Calculus II class and being 2 or 3 girls with around 25 male students. It definitely changes the environment of the classroom. I'm very lucky that when I was growing up I never had the feeling that I can’t do something because I'm a girl. I always had people who believed in me. But when I went to this class I had this vibe that people are taking me less seriously when  I answer the questions. Surely it was not a very obvious sexist environment but you just get this sense that you are less. 
                        I know a few girls who felt so uncomfortable in such environments that they just decided to change a major.

                            <p> I started my Instagram blog when I was in my 3rd year of college in 2018. At that time I firstly started to think if I wanted to get a MdPhd or not. So I opened Instagram to find doctors and people who are doing it or are planning to do it. MdPhd is a very long journey and I was not only curious how other people are doing but also wanted to share my own story. I feel like not enough people talk about this pathway. So I really wanted to record my way. I didn’t expect it to grow that much. I knew that there was a risk in making this account, because what if I change my mind. Eventually I realised that that's just the way life works and if I change my mind I'll share it with my audience and I’ll just be honest. A little while later I decided to try TikTok because the algorithms there are a bit different from Instagram. Now I usually make videos on TikTok and I can also post it on Instagram with helpful advice about applying to medical school or how to choose a good lab and so on. </p>

                <p> My favourite subject at the university was cancer biology. I took this class in the 3rd course when I had already done all the basic requirements of biology courses. This class was very special for me. I was specifically more in the cell biology major and when you took this course you learned how the cell and cell cycle work, how the cell divides and produces more cells. When you have learned how the normal cycle works, the next step is to learn what happens when it goes wrong. When it goes wrong, most of the time it means cancer can result, because cancer just means that the cells are dividing too fast. Basically, I really enjoyed that course because I was a big fan of the subject I was studying.
